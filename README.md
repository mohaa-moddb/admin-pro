# Admin-Pro 1.00 Read me file.

I am not good at writing or read me's so i will try to keep this shrot and sweet. basicaly move all your folders and files
to main. ( see below). Visit http://elgan.funmodsforu.com/ for more help.


## Installation


Before you install you might want to edit the mod settings
so it runs how you want it to run. See SettingsUse a program 
like Winrar to unzip the downloaded file. Inside your will find:

 

1. Ådmin-Pro.pk3
2. Settings ( a folder )
3. Readme.txt

 

Extract all the files inside the file and folders  on to anywhere on your computer.
I would suggest the desktop ( if its not to cluttered ) because you need to then later 
upload it to your server. Now that you have it somewhere handy, you can edit the settings 
to fit your desire. Once done with that I would check it on your mohaa game. Then if all 
is right upload it. If you done and want to upload it or try it on your computer. Move the 
settings folder and the pk3 to either main ( for Alied assault) mainta ( for Spearhead) or maintt ( for Breakthrough).

 

These folders on your pc by default are usually found at ‘c:\program files\ea games\mohaa’



## What now?

You should now have the pk3 and folder inside your games main folder. Edit the settings and settings files found in the settings folder.
