// **************************************************************************************************************************************

// Scripts to run , Having these seperate allow the possibility of adding scripts that can be turned on and off using admin_cmd.
// add to the top of your script,..
//
// if(level.run[ YOUR SCRIPT NAME ] == 0){end}
// 0 = off, 1 = on.
// 
// eg, 
//
// if(level.run[camper] == 0){end} //this shuts off the camper mod 
//
// IF YOU ARE NOT an experienced scripter please just ignore the complicated script and e-mail me if you want a script added that can be turned on and off.
//

// These also are admin_cmd commands. use admin_cmd script_name 0/1 to turn it on or off.
// admin_cmd "camper 0" - would turn camper off.


// Basicaly any mdos that i make in the future i will make two versions. One version you will be able to add to this list of scripts and it will with camper.

// If the game type is not found. The map is not checked for. So it checks gametype first is its there check for map. If not dont run script.
// The camper has a game type and maps list that contains all. This is so you have an example of how to make a list. 
// You will need to make a maps and game types list for the other scripts See me for help. www.mods-r-us.ner

commands:

	// These paths are the paths of settings and text files for new scripts.

	// by default the camper.txt will be loaded and all the commands. Then this list will be loaded with all the commands and settings.
	// This is seperate so you can add mroe and more commands or just seperate them to make things easier and more organised.

 	// Do not remove lines!.

// If you wish for the mod to run faster, have less work for it to do. removing the ammount of commands can aid it. This makes searching for them quicker. This script is not the place to do that though. If you want to remove unused commands
//simply open up the setting file with all the commands in and remove them from the list.

//Removing lines from above can break the script. The scripts use the commands from the settings file but may also exec other section of the file for other data.
//For example the anti camper main camper script gets its commands from the above but also uses this to see what file to exec to get other info like game types.

	// NOTE: "settings/camper" must stay the same path.
	// NOTE: "settings/weapons_limiter" must stay the same path.
// This is because the scripts search for them specific paths
